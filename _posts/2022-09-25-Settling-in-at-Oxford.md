It is peculiar how you can have a vision for your future for the longest time and then right about when the vision is to be turned into lived reality you suddenly start to feel the weight of what you have taken on. In the past two weeks the pressure of starting my PhD hast started to sink in . A subtle but potent version of imposter syndrome pulling my fingers across the keyboard writing literature reviews, across the papers line by line, I want to do better than myself. 

Lucy Kissick, [in one of her videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJPUetIa6HE), once described living in Oxford as being surrounded by greatness and that that would encourage you to be a better version of yourself. I do feel that too. It is not the debilitating imposter syndrome I felt when I first went to university as an 18-year-old. It is a genuine desire to live up to the expectations the people here have of me and to do something and will rival the impact of students that came before me. This sounds overly confident but remeber that it is a wish more so than a determination that I will achieve it. And really, that uncertainty is what makes this mindset so powerful. Success is not guaranteed.

Most of the summer I barely felt any pressure towards starting my PhD. It simply felt like the natural progression of my studies, it was always something I had planned and saw myself do and now the time had come. In some strange way, I had spent my summer in a way that had conjured up the feeling that it might never end. 

Now that the new academic year is here and while I have this motivation, I want to set some goals for the next academic year. My approach to this is very much influenced by James Clear’s Atomic Habits which I read over the summer. It’s a great read but definitely not as good as it is hyped up to be, but more on that another time. 

### My goals and habits for the academic year

- Read more papers and become an expert in my field, maybe not in the first year but slowly and steadily. I want to read one abstract every morning with my cup of tea when I start work
- Focus is so important as a PhD student, in fact I believe it is the most valuable thing we ‘have’. That’s why I actively want to create an environmen where I focus. I want to have two deep work sessions a day where I won’t be distracted and will be able to work on my research.
- The first half year of my program will mainly focus around defining my research project more clearly and do a literature review. To help me do that, I want to write a page a week about the readings I did that week and their importance to the project.

### Stretch goals for the academic year

These are goals that will be a true challenge to reach but even more so important since these are the things that will. I will NOT beat myself up if I don’t meet these goals, they are intended to keep me pushing.

- Write up a paper draft on my research project
- Become an advisor for a climate start up or hold a part-time role in a climate related startup, think tank, insurance company or similar.

Hopefully, I'll be in touch to report how it is going soon. For now I need to prepare for my first day tomorrow!
