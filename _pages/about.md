Hi! I am a doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. My work is in collaboration with the UK Met Office and focuses on extreme event attribution using weather models.

I am affiliated with the DTP in Environmental Research and [St. Cross College](https://www.stx.ox.ac.uk) and receive their [scholarship for a DPhil in Environmental Research](https://www.stx.ox.ac.uk/graduate-scholarship-in-environmental-research).
