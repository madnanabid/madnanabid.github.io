Hi! I am a Earth System Physicsist at the Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics (AOPP), University of Oxford.  My research uses medium-range weather forecasts and seasonal weather predictions to assess atmospheric teleconnections in interbasin framwork. This helps to attribute the signals, which could trigger extremes in different part of the globe including tropics and extratropics.
