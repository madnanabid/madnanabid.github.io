Hi! I am a Earth System Scientist at the Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics (AOPP), University of Oxford. My research focuses on the climate variability and predictability on different time scales, with a focus on inter-basin interactions and teleconnections from the tropical oceans to the extratropical regions. I have worked on different aspects of the climate modelling to understand the role of air-sea interactions in the climate predictions across different timescales (sub-seasonal to season to decadal). My recent research shows that inter-basin interactions is a useful framework to understand sub-seasonality of the El Southern-Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnections to the different regions including Europe, where ENSO establishes its link through the Indian ocean in the early half of the winter, while direct ENSO pathways exists in latter half of the winter. I have noted co-occurrence of the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) and ENSO dominates the early winter variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation. Inter-basin framework helps to attribute the signals from different ocean basins, that could trigger extreme climate conditions in different part of the globe.
